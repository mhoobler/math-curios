        <dt>So the two main elements this component relies on is:</dt>
        <dd>- the left-shift bitwise operator ( &lt;&lt; )</dd>
        <dd>- hexidecimal numbers</dd>
        <br />

        <dt>
          I'm going to try and break down my thought process about the problem
          and how I came up with my solution. Hopefully this doesn't come off as
          too intimidating of a subject, it does involve math, but I try to
          break everything down to it's simplest components.
        </dt>
        <br />
        <!--{/* HEXIDECIMALS */}-->
        <dt>
          <h4>Hexidecimals</h4>
        </dt>

        <dt>
          It was really trippy for me to go from dealing with Base-10 math to
          Base-16 math.
        </dt>
        <br />

        <dt>
          Here's how I think about it now:
          <sup>(Reminder: F == 15 in HEX)</sup>
        </dt>
        <div class="subsection">
          <dt>BASE-N = 10:</dt>
          <dd>-- 100 = 10 * 10</dd>
          <dd>-- 99 = (9 * 10) + 9</dd>
          <dt>BASE-N = 16:</dt>
          <dd>-- 100 = 16 * 16;</dd>
          <dd>-- FF = (15 * 16) + 15;</dd>
        </div>
        <br />

        <dt>
          Let that soak in a bit... okay, now notice how the 15's and the 9's
          line up.
        </dt>

        <dt>
          So if you want a VALUE to go left 1 space, you need to multiply it by
          BASE-N. If you want it to go right, divide.
        </dt>

        <dt>
          It might seem obvious to some people, but I think I spent a good 2
          hours getting used to that and I hope that insight helps save other
          mere mortals like myself some frustration.
        </dt>

        <dt>
          Taking this back to how color strings work. Each color is valued in
          base 16, and the largest value is:
        </dt>
        <div class="subsection">
          <dd>- (15 * 16) + 15;</dd>
          <dd>- which is also FF;</dd>
          <dd>- which is also 255;</dd>
        </div>
        <br />

        <dt>
          It's just Red and Green are shifted (in CSS at least, in canvas it's
          Blue and Green). So "pure Red" is:
        </dt>
        <div class="subsection">
          <dd>- FF0000</dd>
          <dd>- 255 with 4 BASE-16 shifts;</dd>
          <dd>- 255 * (16 * 16 * 16 * 16) ;</dd>
        </div>
        <br/>

        <!-- {/* BITWISE */} -->
        <dt>
          <h4>Left-shift Bitwise</h4>
        </dt>

        <dt>
          It's pretty useful to think about (x &lt;&lt; y) as being similar to
          (x * (2 ^ y)).
        </dt>

        <div class="subsection">
          <dd>
            It's more complicated than that (especially when getting into large
            numbers or floats), but it's very useful to think about it like that
            here.
          </dd>
        </div>

        <dt>
          I don't want to get too much into binary numbers, but the &lt;&lt;
          operation shifts the binary array to the left (the &gt;&gt; shifts to
          the right).
        </dt>

        <div class="subsection">
          <dt>2 &lt;&lt; 1 = 4</dt>
          <dd>- 0010 &lt;&lt; 0001 = 0100</dd>
          <dt>2 &lt;&lt; 2 = 8</dt>
          <dd>- 0010 &lt;&lt; 0010 = 1000</dd>
          <dt>3 &lt;&lt; 2 = 12</dt>
          <dd>- 0011 &lt;&lt; 0010 = 1100</dd>
          <dd>- (3 * (2^2))</dd>
        </div>
        <br />

        <!-- {/* CONCLUSION */} -->
        <dt>
          <h4>So bringing things together:</h4>
        </dt>

        <dt>You can sort of think of FF as 99.</dt>
        <dt>
          So if you want FF00 you do something very similar to if you wanted
          9900.
        </dt>

        <div class="subsection">
          <dt>9900 = (99 * 10 * 10);</dt>
          <dt>FF00 = (FF * 16 * 16);</dt>
        </div>
        <br />

        <dt>
          The nice thing about hexidecial is that it fits nicely with binary.
        </dt>

        <div class="subsection">
          <dt>FF00 = (FF * [4 * 4] * [4 * 4]);</dt>
          <dt>FF00 = ( FF * [2 * 2 * 2 * 2] * [2 * 2 * 2 * 2] );</dt>
        </div>

        <dt>
          And there's 8 two's so we can just throw them all together with a
          power.
        </dt>
        <div class="subsection">
          <dt>FF00 = ( FF * (2^8))</dt>
        </div>
        <dt>
          Going back to the left-shift, if you remember (x &lt;&lt; y), this is
          doing exactly the same thing as (FF &lt;&lt; 8) or (255 &lt;&lt; 8)
        </dt>

          <h4>Some final thoughts and words of encouragement</h4>
        </dt>

        <dt>
          So I started figuring all this stuff out by playing around with the
          code found
          <a
            href="https://compile.fi/canvas-filled-three-ways-js-webassembly-and-webgl/"
            >here</a
          >
          and trying to get a better understanding of the canvas element and
          webassembly.
        
          I think I spent around 6-10 hours playing around with the code (aka
          bashing my head against a wall) spread across a week before I really
          got an understanding of what was going on at even a basic level.
        </dt>

        <dt>
          What I'm trying to say is that it's okay to find stuff like this hard.
          Back in the day, I would've spent 4 hours straight going nowhere,
          getting frustrated to the point of burnout, and then quit programming
          for a month or more. Take a break, work on something else, or
          reach-out and ask a question. As long as you keep trying you'll get
          there
